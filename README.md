# Advent of Code 2019

This is my attempt to work through the 2019 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) exercises in Clojure. This should be interesting, because I don't know Clojure!

## Running

To run these examples, you'll need `leiningen`. Installation methods vary, but on OSX it should be as simple as `brew install leiningen`. 

```
$ lein day01
```
